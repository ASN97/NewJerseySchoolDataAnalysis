This project merges New Jersey school enrollment data (grades 5â€“8), Title I allocations, and NCES crosswalks to align districts via LEAID.
It uses Python (pandas) for cleaning, joining, and filtering, ensuring only valid Title I districts are included.
The output dataset supports analysis and visualization  for ranking counties and schools.
